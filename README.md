***'The digital world inside our computers works in exact and with calculated ways'***, and that's the mindset I like to have whenever I do my work.

Hi there! I am a full-stack web developer who takes comfort from the repetitive part of programming and finds excitement from the endless learning in this field. I enjoy building projects, solving problems, and getting things done. I am skilled in MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS and Firebase. I mostly work with the MERN stack but I'm very eager to learn more technologies.

Here are some of the projects I have build! ðŸš€ðŸš€

### ShoutOut: Social Media Website 

![](./images/shoutout_feed.png)

It is a social media website design for people to share their thoughts and follow other people's thoughts. I built it from scratch including authentication, and used JWT for authorization. You can follow other users and it generates a Feed which contains your posts and posts of all the users you are following. You can like a post, view other usersâ€™ profile and unfollow them if you want.

The front-end is made using ReactJS and Chakra UI. The back-end API is made using NodeJS and ExpressJS and is currently deployed in Heroku. All the data are stored in MongoDB Atlas database.

You can visit the website hosted in Netlify using this [link](https://inspiring-noether-356180.netlify.app/feed)
