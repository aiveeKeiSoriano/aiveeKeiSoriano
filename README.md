***'The digital world inside our computers works in exact and with calculated ways'***, and that's the mindset I like to have whenever I do my work.

Hi there! I'm Aivee Kei Soriano, a full-stack web developer who takes comfort from the repetitive part of programming and finds excitement from the endless learning in this field. I enjoy building projects, solving problems, and getting things done. I am skilled in MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS and Firebase. I mostly work with the MERN stack but I'm very eager to learn more technologies.

Here are some of the major projects I have build! ðŸš€ðŸš€

## ShoutOut: Social Media Website | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/aiveeKeiSoriano/social-media)

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/aiveeKeiSoriano/social-media)

It is a social media website design for people to share their thoughts and follow other people's thoughts. I built it from scratch including authentication, and used JWT for authorization. You can follow other users and it generates a Feed which contains your posts and posts of all the users you are following. You can like a post, view other usersâ€™ profile and unfollow them if you want.

Front-end:
- ReactJS
- Redux
- Chakra UI

Back-end API:
- NodeJS 
- ExpressJS 
- Heroku
- MongoDB Atlas database

You can visit the website hosted in Netlify using this [link](https://inspiring-noether-356180.netlify.app/feed)
You can create your own new account or login using *aiveekei* as username and *testpass* as password
