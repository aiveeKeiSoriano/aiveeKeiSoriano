***'The digital world inside our computers works in exact and with calculated ways'***, and that's the mindset I like to have whenever I do my work.

Hi there! I am a full-stack web developer who takes comfort from the repetitive part of programming and finds excitement from the endless learning in this field. I enjoy building projects, solving problems, and getting things done. I am skilled in MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS and Firebase. I mostly work with the MERN stack but I'm very eager to learn more technologies.

Here are some of the projects I have build! ðŸš€ðŸš€
